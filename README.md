# Introduction

This is a Code Club project to build a simple web application to interact with and visualise NASA's ENONET [API](https://eonet.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/).
The data from this API provides information about past and current worldwide natural events. We will use HTML, CSS and JavaScript to build this application.

## Getting Started

- Read the API documentation [here](https://eonet.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/v3)
- Refer to the Code Club [backlog](https://dev.azure.com/allenovery/Code%20Club/_backlogs/backlog/Code%20Club%20Team/Epics/) for more details about the planned work
